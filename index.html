      <h2>Learn About my Passion</h2>

      <p>In this day and age, data is more important than ever.
        However, good data is not very accessible to most ordinary folks,
        so I am a firm believer of well-designed, interactive data
        visualizations, that allow all people the ability to make their
        own data driven decisions.</p>

      <p class="floated"> Born and raised in Chapel Hill, NC, I have always
        enjoyed living by a university with all of the
        academics and opportunities it affords. Now that I attend Duke university
        I get to fully take advantage of the university perks. I enjoy doing
        research, teaching, and working on data projects that I am excited by.
        In the 2019-20 academic year, I worked with a research group that analyzed
        longterm, whole ecosystem data from the ELA (Experimental Lakes Area) as to best
        visualize and communicate the crucial environmental findings. Over the summer
        I interned at Amazon as a software development engineering intern. This fall,
      I volunteered on a political campaign as a data analyst. Two other
      undergraduate students and I ran analyses for and strategized with the
      campaign team in order to best support them. Over the winter I volunteered
      on the communications and marketing working group with Bluebonnet Data, the
      organization I volunteered with in the fall. This semester I will be a teaching
      assistant for two undergraduate classes.</p>
      <p class="floated"> I have experience with both software development and data science.
        I have also taken several classes pertaining to both, including classes on
        algorithms, machine learning, data science, bayesian statistics, linear algebra
        and more. I have participated in several hackathons and datathons, including
        Duke's datafest where I won best prize for visualization.
